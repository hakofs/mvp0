Hako (MVP0-version)
===============================

Welcome to Hako MVP0. This is the first MVP version of the Hako interpreter
and file system. Time will tell whether this current version will stand.

The project specifications and the goals are changing as we speak! Such is the power
of development.

## What is Hako?

Hako is a data system that aims to consolidate all possible forms of data into one human-readable data type. Hako files and containers can be used to represent a wide range of data, from web apps and APIs to Kanban boards and mograph projects!

Hako was designed initially as a response to the growing complexity of starting pet projects and outgrowing large dependencies on rapidly changing ecosystems (see: web development, SPAs). I hope to develop a system where developers and content creators can define projects and data on their own terms.

## I want to see examples!

Sure thing! Head over to the `examples` folder to see examples of Hako in play. Some examples to note:

| Path | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![webapp-henlo](examples/webapp-henlo) | Say henlo (hello world) in a web app! | Version 1.0 |
| ![webapp-jukebox](examples/webapp-jukebox) | Make a shared jukebox system where users can collaboratively queue music | In Progress |

More to be planned soon!
